## **Overview and Origin**

* **Name of company**

    [Adyen N.V.](www.adyen.com) (Euronext: [ADYEN](https://live.euronext.com/en/product/equities/NL0012969182-XAMS))

* **When was the company incorporated?**

    The company was in incorporated in 2006. Adyen announced on May 24th 2018 their intention to go public. The IPO took place on June 13th 2018 when they listed as ADYEN on Euronext Amsterdam. They are headquarted in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and employ more than 1,400 employees in twenty-one offices around the world.[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.adyen.com/about)

* **Who are the founders of the company?**

    Adyen was founded by a two seasoned payment industry professionals: [Mr. Pieter van der Does](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pieter-van-der-does-4824b11/) and [Mr. Arnout Schuijff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnoutschuijff/). Van der Does currently serves as CEO and Schuijff is CTO.

* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**

    >**Adyen: afresh, again, all over again**

     *Sranantongo, Suriname's mostly used language*       

    It is no coincidence the founders specificaly named their new company Adyen: to do it all over again. Van der Does and Schuijff previously founded a payment operator company called Bibit, which was acquired by Royal Bank of Scotland in 2004 for €001MM. Exactly two years later - on the day their *lock-up* period expired - they decided they wanted to 'start all over again'. The result? Adyen.
    
    Bibit started as a billing platform for small amounts of content. Amsterdam-based exchange AEX was one of the first customers using Bibit to sell financial information. Later on Bibit pivoted into payments and became on of the first companies to process the growing number of online payments as a result of the growing e-business model.[<sup>2</sup>](https://startupjuncture.com/2014/01/22/payments-startup-adyen) 

    Bibit showcased the enormous potential in the online payment industry. It was time to work on a next generation platform. 

    >*'Bibit was cutting-edge when it was acquired by RBS, but after three years of stagnation, I and others decided that we wanted to work on a next generation platform*[<sup>3</sup>](https://startupjuncture.com/2014/01/22/payments-startup-adyen)

* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**

    The fact that Adyen's two co-founders Pieter van der Does and Arnout Schuijff sold their previous company Bibit to Royal Bank of Schotland for €100MM, for a long time ensured sufficient funding for newely founded Adyen. It was only in September of 2011 (five years after they founded the company!) when they raised their first additional capital of €16MM. In subsequent years they closed several other funding rounds. In 2015 they closed their last funding round with Iconiq Capital and were valued at $2.3BN. In total they raised $282MM before going public in 2018.[<sup>4</sup>](https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organizations/funding_total/adyen)
